I would like to begin by thanking my advisor, Professor Paul Shea. This has been a truly wonderful experience. Thank you for sharing it with me.\\

My roommates Jordana Gluckow and Jake Barbato for catching typos, bringing me food from Commons, and listening to me drone on endlessly about my thesis.\\

Matt Duvall and Robert Spellman, without whom I could not have analyzed my data.\\

My friends Ben Gilmore, Arnaud Cluzel, Matthew Neal, Maxwell Goldfarb, Darnell Morrow, Ali Hakasui, Alex Donatelle, Charlie McKitrick, Hannah Kiesler, and the Men's Water Polo Team for their constant love and support.\\

Finally, I would like to thank my family; Mom, Dad, Shane, and Emme. I love you all.
